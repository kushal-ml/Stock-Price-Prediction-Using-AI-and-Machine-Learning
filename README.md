Stock Price Prediction Using AI and Machine Learning
The project is to download the dataset of stock data of any ticker and find a comparison between actual stock price and predicted stock price.
For this project, I have downloaded the stock data of NETFLIX for the last ten years, i.e., from Feb 2014 to Feb 2024.
